          <h1>Neptune</h1>
          <p class="intro">
            Neptune is the eighth, and most distant planet from the Sun. It’s
            the fourth-largest, and the first planet discovered with math.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not
            visible to the naked eye. The planet’s blue color comes from methane
            in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but
            allows blue ones to be reflected back into space – very much like
            its neighbor, Uranus. Neptune was the first planet located using
            math. German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe the
            planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea.

          <p>
            Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great
            distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be
            three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than
            Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet
            at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per
            hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per
            hour (400 kilometers per hour).
