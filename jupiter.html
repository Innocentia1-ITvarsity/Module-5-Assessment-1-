          <h1>Jupiter</h1>
          <p class="intro">
            Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar
            system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside
          </p>
          <p>
            Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy
            clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen
            and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the
            lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in
            opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant
            storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

            Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know
            it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize
            this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms
            to adapt to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living
            things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.
            Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our
            solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy
            crust, where life could possibly be supported.
